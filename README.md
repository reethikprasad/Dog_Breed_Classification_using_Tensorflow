# Dog Breed Classification using Tensorflow
Who's that doggy in the window?

Dogs are incredible. But have you ever been sitting at a cafe, seen a dog and not known what breed it is? I have. And then someone says, "it's an English Terrier" and you think, how did they know that?

This kind of problem is called multi-class image classification. It's multi-class because we're trying to classify mutliple different breeds of dog. If we were only trying to classify dogs versus cats, it would be called binary classification.
In this project I going to be using machine learning to help us identify different breeds of dogs.
For the machine learning model, I am going to be using a pretrained deep learning model from TensorFlow Hub.
## Project Overview:
This repo contains all my work for Project DOG BREED classification. In this project, I have learned about unstructured Data,Setting up Google colab Workspace, using Tensorflow,Preprocessing images,Turning Data into batches,preventing overfitting,saving and loading a trained modelEach model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.As a CS student of SRMIST and a long-time self-taught learner, This is my first big project
